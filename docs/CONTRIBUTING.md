## Rules

1. **Test everything you add or fix**. Functionality that is not tested is a headache to the future.
1. **Document everything you add**, even an small option. If the functionality is hidden in the code, it is not useful.
In general, we add a brief in the `README.md` and we extend the information in a file inside `/docs`.
1. **Avoid making Pull Requests with multiple changes**. If you intend to add/fix several things, please make a PR for each one.
1. **Respect the style rules**. We use rubocop, stylelint and eslint. Te rules are in the root of this gem.
1. **Ask before attempting to add new features**. In Platanus, we open the code of this gem to spread the happiness but we don't want to maintain things that are not useful for the company. Remember that you can always fork this gem and modify it according to your needs.
